    "Ordinary errors are handled using the Result type. Results typically represent prob‐ lems caused by things outside the program, like erroneous input, a network outage, or a permissions problem. That such situations occur is not up to us; even a bug-free program will encounter them from time to time. Most of this chapter is dedicated to that kind of error. We’ll cover panic first, though, because it’s the simpler of the two.\n",

    "## Panic\n",
    "A program panics when it encounters something so messed up that there must be a bug in the program itself. Something like:\n",
    "* Out-of-bounds array access\n",
    "* Integer division by zero\n",
    "* Calling `.expect()` on a Result that happens to be `Err`\n",
    "* Assertion failure\n",
    "\n",
    "(There’s also the macro `panic!()`, for cases where your own code discovers that it has gone wrong, and you therefore need to trigger a panic directly. `panic!()` accepts optional `println!()`-style arguments, for building an error message.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But we all make mistakes. When these errors that shouldn’t happen do happen—what then? Remarkably, Rust gives you a choice. Rust can either unwind the stack when a panic happens or abort the process. Unwinding is the default."

    "In Rust, it triggers a panic, which typically proceeds as follows:\n",
    "* An error message is printed to the terminal\n",
    "* The stack is unwound. This is a lot like C++ exception handling.\n",
    "Any temporary values, local variables, or arguments that the current function was using are dropped, in the reverse of the order they were created. Dropping a value simply means cleaning up after it: any Strings or Vecs the program was using are freed, any open Files are closed, and so on. User-defined drop methods are called too. Once the current function call is cleaned up, we move on to its caller, dropping its variables and arguments the same way. Then we move to that function’s caller, and so on up the stack.\n",
    "* Finally, the thread exits. If the panicking thread was the main thread, then the whole process exits (with a nonzero exit code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps panic is a misleading name for this orderly process. A panic is not a crash. It’s not undefined behavior. It’s more like a `RuntimeException` in Java or a `std::logic_error` in C++. The behavior is well-defined; it just shouldn’t be happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panic is safe. It doesn’t violate any of Rust’s safety rules; even if you manage to panic in the middle of a standard library method, it will never leave a dangling pointer or a half-initialized value in memory. The idea is that Rust catches the invalid array access, or whatever it is, before anything bad happens. It would be unsafe to proceed, so Rust unwinds the stack. But the rest of the process can continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panic is per thread. One thread can be panicking while other threads are going on about their normal business.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a way to catch stack unwinding, allowing the thread to survive and continue running. The standard library function `std::panic::catch_unwind()` does this. "

    "### Aborting\n",
    "Stack unwinding is the default panic behavior, but there are two circumstances in which Rust does not try to unwind the stack.\n",
    "If a `.drop()` method triggers a second panic while Rust is still trying to clean up after the first, this is considered fatal. Rust stops unwinding and aborts the whole process.\n",
    "Also, Rust’s panic behavior is customizable. If you compile with `-C panic=abort`, the first panic in your program immediately aborts the process. (With this option, Rust does not need to know how to unwind the stack, so this can reduce the size of your compiled code.)"

    "```\n",
    "This means that a Result type alias is being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "A type alias is a kind of shorthand for type names. Modules often define a Result type alias to avoid having to repeat an error type that’s used consistently by almost every function in the module. For example, the standard library’s `std::io` module includes this line of code:\n",
    "```Rust\n",
    "pub type Result<T> = result::Result<T, Error>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This defines a public type `std::io::Result<T>`. It’s an alias for `Result<T, E>`, but hardcodes `std::io::Error` as the error type. In practical terms, this means that if you write use `std::io`;, then Rust will understand `io::Result<String>` as shorthand for `Result<String, io::Error>`.\n",
    "When something like `Result<()>` appears in the online documentation, you can click on the identifier `Result` to see which type alias is being used and learn the error type. In practice, it’s usually obvious from context."

    "### Handling Errors in main()\n",
    "In most places where a Result is produced, letting the error bubble up to the caller is the right behavior. This is why `?` is a single character in Rust. As we’ve seen, in some programs it’s used on many lines of code in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you propagate an error long enough, eventually it reaches `main()`, and something has to be done with it. Normally, `main()` can’t use `?` because its return type is not `Result`:\n",
    "```Rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    calculate_tides()?; // error: can't pass the buck any further\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The simplest way to handle errors in main() is to use `.expect()`:\n",
    "```Rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    calculate_tides().expect(\"error\"); // the buck stops here\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "If `calculate_tides()` returns an error result, the `.expect()` method panics. Panicking in the main thread prints an error message and then exits with a nonzero exit code, which is roughly the desired behavior. We use this all the time for tiny programs. It’s a start.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message is a little intimidating, though:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ tidecalc --planet mercury\n",
    "thread 'main' panicked at 'error: \"moon not found\"', src/main.rs:2:23\n",
    "note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n",
    "```\n",
    "The error message is lost in the noise. Also, `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` is bad advice in this particular case.\n",
    "However, you can also change the type signature of `main()` to return a `Result` type, so you can use `?`:\n",
    "```Rust\n",
    "fn main() -> Result<(), TideCalcError> { \n",
    "    let tides = calculate_tides()?; \n",
    "    print_tides(tides);\n",
    "    Ok(())\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This works for any error type that can be printed with the `{:?}` formatter, which all standard error types, like `std::io::Error`, can be. This technique is easy to use and gives a somewhat nicer error message, but it’s not ideal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ tidecalc --planet mercury\n",
    "Error: TideCalcError { error_type: NoMoon, message: \"moon not found\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you have more complex error types or want to include more details in your message, it pays to print the error message yourself:\n",
    "```Rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    if let Err(err) = calculate_tides() {\n",
    "        print_error(&err);\n",
