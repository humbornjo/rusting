    "# Closures\n",
    "## Capturing Variables\n",
    "In most languages with closures, garbage collection plays an important role. For example, consider this JavaScript code:\n",
    "```Rust\n",
    "// Start an animation that rearranges the rows in a table of cities.\n",
    "function startSortingAnimation(cities, stat) {\n",
    "    // Helper function that we'll use to sort the table. \n",
    "    // Note that this function refers to stat.\n",
    "    function keyfn(city) {\n",
    "        return city.get_statistic(stat); \n",
    "    }\n",
    "    if (pendingSort) pendingSort.cancel();\n",
    "    // Now kick off an animation, passing keyfn to it. \n",
    "    // The sorting algorithm will call keyfn later. \n",
    "    pendingSort = new SortingAnimation(cities, keyfn);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The closure `keyfn` is stored in the new `SortingAnimation` object. It’s meant to be called after `startSortingAnimation` returns. Now, normally when a function returns, all its variables and arguments go out of scope and are discarded. But here, the JavaScript engine must keep `stat` around somehow, since the closure uses it. Most JavaScript engines do this by allocating stat in the heap and letting the garbage collector reclaim it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust doesn’t have garbage collection. How will this work? To answer this question, we’ll look at two examples."

    "### Closures That Borrow\n",
    "```Rust\n",
    "/// Sort by any of several different statistics.\n",
    "fn sort_by_statistic(cities: &mut Vec<City>, stat: Statistic) { \n",
    "    cities.sort_by_key(|city| -city.get_statistic(stat));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "实际上，这个例子有问题，sort_by_key接受一个FnMut的参数，能执行例子中的代码的前提是，Statistic实现了Copy trait，书本中并未说明。\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, when Rust creates the closure, it automatically borrows a reference to stat. It stands to reason: the closure refers to stat, so it must have a reference to it.\n",
    "The rest is simple. The closure is subject to the rules about borrowing and lifetimes that we described in **Chapter 5**. In particular, since the closure contains a reference to stat, Rust won’t let it outlive stat. Since the closure is only used during sorting, this example is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Rust ensures safety by using lifetimes instead of garbage collection. Rust’s way is faster: even a fast GC allocation will be slower than storing stat on the stack, as Rust does in this case."

    "    // Helper function that we'll use to sort the table. \n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "在这里，闭包存储在了`new SortingAnimation`这个对象中。一般来说，离开函数作用域后，变量就会被GC回收。但是此处，为了保全这个闭包，js会在堆上开辟空间让这个变量苟活，使得这个变量稍后再被GC回收。\n"
