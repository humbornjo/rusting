    "Rust’s enums may be new to systems programming, but they are not a new idea. Trav‐ eling under various academic-sounding names, like algebraic data types, they’ve been used in functional programming languages for more than forty years. It’s unclear why so few other languages in the C tradition have ever had them. Perhaps it is simply that for a programming language designer, combining variants, references, mutability, and memory safety is extremely challenging. Functional programming languages dispense with mutability. C unions, by contrast, have variants, pointers, and mutability —but are so spectacularly unsafe that even in C, they’re a last resort. Rust’s borrow checker is the magic that makes it possible to combine all four without compromise."
