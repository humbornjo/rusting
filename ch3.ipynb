    "## References\n",
    "At run time, a reference to an `i32` is a single machine word holding the address of the `i32`, which may be on the stack or in the heap. The expression `&x` produces a reference to `x`; in Rust terminology, we say that it borrows a reference to `x`. Given a reference `r`, the expression `*r` refers to the value `r` points to. These are very much like the `&` and `*` operators in C and C++. And like a C pointer, a reference does not automatically free any resources when it goes out of scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike C pointers, however, Rust references are never null: there is simply no way to produce a null reference in safe Rust. And unlike C, Rust tracks the ownership and lifetimes of values, so mistakes like dangling pointers, double frees, and pointer inva‐ lidation are ruled out at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust references come in two flavors: \n",
    "\n",
    "`&T`: \n",
    "An immutable, shared reference. You can have many shared references to a given value at a time, but they are read-only: modifying the value they point to is for‐ bidden, as with `const T*` in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "`&mut T`: \n",
    "A mutable, exclusive reference. You can read and modify the value it points to, as with a T* in C. But for as long as the reference exists, you may not have any other references of any kind to that value. In fact, the only way you may access the value at all is through the mutable reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rust uses this dichotomy between shared and mutable references to enforce a “single writer or multiple readers” rule: either you can read and write the value, or it can be shared by any number of readers, but never both at the same time. This separation, enforced by compile-time checks, is central to Rust’s safety guarantees. Chapter 5 explains Rust’s rules for safe reference use.**"

    "* The types `&[T]` and `&mut [T]`, called a shared slice of Ts and mutable slice of Ts, are references to a series of elements that are a part of some other value, like an array or vector. You can think of a slice as a pointer to its first element, together with a count of the number of elements you can access starting at that point. A mutable slice `&mut [T]` lets you read and modify elements, but can’t be shared; a shared slice `&[T]` lets you share access among several readers, but doesn’t let you modify elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a value `v` of any of these three types, the expression `v.len()` gives the number of elements in `v`, and `v[i]` refers to the ith element of `v`. The first element is `v[0]`, and the last element is `v[v.len() - 1]`. Rust checks that `i` always falls within this range; if it doesn’t, the expression panics. The length of `v` may be zero, in which case any attempt to index it will panic. `i` must be a usize value; you can’t use any other integer type as an index."

    "Keep in mind that, given the nature of Unicode, simple char-by-char comparison does not always give the expected answers. For example, the Rust strings \"th\\u{e9}\" and \"the\\u{301}\" are both valid Unicode representations for thé, the French word for tea. Unicode says they should both be displayed and processed in the same way, but Rust treats them as two completely distinct strings. Similarly, Rust’s ordering operators like `<` use a simple lexicographical order based on character code point values. This ordering only sometimes resembles the ordering used for text in the user’s language and culture. "

    "Rust guarantees that strings are valid UTF-8. Sometimes a program really needs to be able to deal with strings that are not valid Unicode. This usually happens when a Rust program has to interoperate with some other system that doesn’t enforce any such rules. For example, in most operating systems it’s easy to create a file with a filename that isn’t valid Unicode. What should happen when a Rust program comes across this sort of filename?\n",
    "Rust’s solution is to offer a few string-like types for these situations:\n",
    "* Stick to String and &str for Unicode text.\n",
    "* When working with filenames, use `std::path::PathBuf` and `&Path` instead.\n",
    "* When working with binary data that isn’t UTF-8 encoded at all, use `Vec<u8>` and `&[u8]`.\n",
    "* When working with environment variable names and command-line arguments in the native form presented by the operating system, use `OsString` and `&OsStr`.\n",
    "* When interoperating with C libraries that use null-terminated strings, use `std::ffi::CString` and `&CStr`."
