    "Rust programs don’t usually explicitly drop values at all, in the way C and C++ pro‐ grams would use free and delete. The way to drop a value in Rust is to remove it from the ownership tree somehow: by leaving the scope of a variable, or deleting an element from a vector, or something of that sort. At that point, Rust ensures the value is properly dropped, along with everything it owns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a certain sense, Rust is less powerful than other languages: every other practical programming language lets you build arbitrary graphs of objects that point to each other in whatever way you see fit. But it is exactly because Rust is less powerful that the analyses the language can carry out on your programs can be more powerful. Rust’s safety guarantees are possible exactly because the relationships it may encounter in your code are more tractable. This is part of Rust’s “radical wager” we mentioned earlier: in practice, Rust claims, there is usually more than enough flexi‐ bility in how one goes about solving a problem to ensure that at least a few perfectly fine solutions fall within the restrictions the language imposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the concept of ownership as we’ve explained it so far is still much too rigid to be useful. Rust extends this simple idea in several ways:\n",
    "* You can move values from one owner to another. This allows you to build, rearrange, and tear down the tree.\n",
    "* Very simple types like integers, floating-point numbers, and characters are excused from the ownership rules. These are called Copy types.\n",
    "* The standard library provides the reference-counted pointer types `Rc` and `Arc`, which allow values to have multiple owners, under some restrictions.\n",
    "* You can “borrow a reference” to a value; references are non-owning pointers, with limited lifetimes.\n",

The source relinquishes ownership of the value to the destination and becomes uninitialized; the destination now controls the value’s lifetime. Rust programs build up and tear down complex structures one value at a time, one move at a time.\n",

The comparison also makes the meaning and consequences of Rust’s choice easier to see.\n",

    "Why aren’t user-defined types automatically Copy, assuming they’re eligible? Whether a type is Copy or not has a big effect on how code is allowed to use it: Copy types are more flexible, since assignment and related operations don’t leave the original unini‐ tialized. But for a type’s implementer, the opposite is true: Copy types are very limited in which types they can contain, whereas non-Copy types can use heap allocation and own other sorts of resources. So making a type Copy represents a serious commitment on the part of the implementer: if it’s necessary to change it to non-Copy later, much of the code that uses it will probably need to be adapted.\n",
    "\n",
    "While C++ lets you overload assignment operators and define specialized copy and move constructors, Rust doesn’t permit this sort of customization. In Rust, every move is a byte-for-byte, shallow copy that leaves the source uninitialized. Copies are the same, except that the source remains initialized. This does mean that C++ classes can provide convenient interfaces that Rust types cannot, where ordinary-looking code implicitly adjusts reference counts, puts off expensive copies for later, or uses other sophisticated implementation tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the effect of this flexibility on C++ as a language is to make basic operations like assignment, passing parameters, and returning values from functions less predictable. For example, earlier in this chapter we showed how assigning one variable to another in C++ can require arbitrary amounts of memory and processor time. One of Rust’s principles is that costs should be apparent to the programmer. Basic operations must remain simple. Potentially expensive operations should be explicit, like the calls to clone in the earlier example that make deep copies of vectors and the strings they contain."

If you don’t need to share the pointers between threads, there’s no reason to pay the performance penalty of an `Arc`, so you should use `Rc`; Rust will prevent you from accidentally passing one across a thread boundary. The two types are otherwise equivalent, so for the rest of this section, we’ll only talk about Rc.\n",

    "It is possible to leak values in Rust this way, but such situations are rare. You cannot create a cycle without, at some point, making an older value point to a newer value. This obviously requires the older value to be mutable. Since `Rc` pointers hold their referents immutable, it’s not normally possible to create a cycle.\n",

    "这段话如何理解：Rust不允许未初始化的值，也就是说，old的对象指向的一定是一个已存在的值（更old的对象），也就是上图中从右向左的指针是可以存在的（认为左边的对象是更old的）。但是想要构成循环引用，就需要让old的对象的指针指向新的对象，但是此时old的指针已经指向了更old的对象了；已知Rc指针是immutable的，所以原则来说，在Rust的规则下，循环引用不可能存在。"

    "However, Rust does provide ways to create mutable portions of otherwise immutable values; this is called _interior mutability_, and we cover it in “Interior Mutability” on page 225. If you com‐ bine those techniques with Rc pointers, you can create a cycle and leak memory.\n",
