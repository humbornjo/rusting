    "# Structs\n",
    "Rust has three kinds of struct types, named-field, tuple-like, and unit-like, which differ in how you refer to their components: a named-field struct gives a name to each com‐ ponent, whereas a tuple-like struct identifies them by the order in which they appear. Unit-like structs have no components at all; these are not common, but more useful than you might think."

    "## Deriving Common Traits for Struct Types\n",
    "Structs can be very easy to write:\n",
    "```Rust\n",
    "struct Point { \n",
    "    x: f64,\n",
    "    y: f64 \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, if you were to start using this Point type, you would quickly notice that it’s a bit of a pain. As written, Point is not copyable or cloneable. You can’t print it with println!`(\"{:?}\", point);` and it does not support the `==` and `!=` operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these features has a name in Rust—`Copy`, `Clone`, `Debug`, and `PartialEq`. They are called traits. In the case of these standard traits, and several others, you don’t need to implement them by hand unless you want some kind of custom behavior. Rust can automatically implement them for you, with mechanical accuracy. Just add a `#[derive]` attribute to the struct:\n",
    "```Rust\n",
    "#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]\n",
    "struct Point { \n",
    "    x: f64,\n",
    "    y: f64 \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each of these traits can be implemented automatically for a struct, provided that each of its fields implements the trait. We can ask Rust to derive `PartialEq` for `Point` because its two fields are both of type `f64`, which already implements `PartialEq`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust can also derive PartialOrd, which would add support for the comparison operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. We haven’t done so here, because comparing two points to see if one is “less than” the other is actually a pretty weird thing to do. There’s no one conventional order on points. So we choose not to support those operators for Point values. Cases like this are one reason that Rust makes us write the `#[derive]` attribute rather than automatically deriving every trait it can. Another reason is that implementing a trait is automatically a public feature, so copyability, cloneability, and so forth are all part of your struct’s public API and should be chosen deliberately."
